Description: This package provides a set of functions to simulate single-cell ATAC-seq
             count matrix from real single-cell samples. simATAC first estimates the 
             parameters of statistical models fitted to the library size, bin count mean, 
             and non-zero cell proportion parameters. simATAC generates the final synthetic 
             counts using the estimated models.
