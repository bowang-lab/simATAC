Description: This package provides a set of functions to simulate single-cell ATAC-seq
             count matrix from real single-cell samples, highly resembling real scATAC-seq 
             datasets in library size, sparsity, and averaged chromatin accessibility 
             signals. simATAC estimates the parameters of statistical distributions fitted 
             to the main parameters, and generates the final synthetic counts using the 
             estimated models.
