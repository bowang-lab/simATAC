# simATAC

simATAC is an R package for the simple simulation of single-cell ATAC sequencing
data. simATAC simulates feature matrices from rela scATAC-seq bin by cell matrix 
by estimating the modelling parameters of three main parameters: library size, 
bin mean, and non-zero cell proportion, and using estimated paramters to simualte
counts. 

simATAC is built on top of [`scater`][scater] and stores simulations in
[`SingleCellExperiment`][SCE] objects. Splatter also has functions for comparing
simulations and real datasets.

The [`SingleCellExperiment`][SCE] object generated by simATAC can be converted to 
binary count matrix, peak by cell matrix, and any feature matrix version by giving 
desired genomic regions in BED file.

## Installation.


## Getting started

simATAC tutorial is provided for explanations and exmaples to start working with simATAC 
and different facilities of it. 

Alternatively, if you chose to build the vignette, you can load Splatter, then
browse the vignettes:

```{r}
library(splatter)
browseVignettes("splatter")
```

This is a detailed document that introduces the main features of Splatter.
