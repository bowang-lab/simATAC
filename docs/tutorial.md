simATAC is an R package developed for simualting single-cell ATAC sequencing (scATAC-seq) count matrices. simATAC is a simple easy to use framework that gets a group of cells having similar biological characteristics in the format of bin by cell matrix as an input, and generates a synthetic bin by cell matrix. simATAC performs estimating and simualting steps in order to generate final synthetic count matrix. There are separate functions for each step, and examples are provided.
